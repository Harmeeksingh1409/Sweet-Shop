### Reflection on AI Impact

AI played a significant role in improving my productivity by reducing time spent on repetitive and boilerplate tasks. It helped me think more clearly about system design, testing strategies, and clean code practices. Rather than replacing learning, AI acted as a support tool that accelerated development while keeping all technical decisions under my control.
